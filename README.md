Getting Started
Step 1: Sign Up & Authentication
Head over to our sign-up page and create an account using Google, GitHub, or custom OAuth.
Step 2: Create a New Project
Click on "Create New Project" to get started. You’ll be prompted to select your app’s platform (Web, Mobile, etc.) and provide a basic project name.
Step 3: Build Your Application
Use our drag-and-drop editor to design your UI. Add components like buttons, text fields, charts, and more.
For backend logic, use the visual workflow editor to create complex business logic without writing any code. Connect your app to APIs, manage authentication, and automate processes.
Step 4: Integrate External Services
Easily connect your app with third-party databases, APIs, and external services. Add integrations from our marketplace or set up custom ones via configuration.
Step 5: Collaborate in Real-Time
Invite team members to collaborate. Share components, assign tasks, and keep track of updates.
Step 6: Deploy Your App
Once you’re satisfied with your app, click on Deploy. Your app is hosted in a scalable, production-ready environment. Monitor its health and performance through the built-in analytics dashboard.
